## Exploring the relationship of gender, crime and punishment in the late 18th Century England (1750-1799) - Using the Proceedings of the Old Bailey Digital Archive 

This project aims to analyze trial records in a database from the early stages of the industrial revolution, specifically from 1750 to 1799, from the [Old Bailey Digital Archive](https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/). The project can be divided into three main parts. 

**Part 1**
- Collect the trial records from the database during this period in XML format and cleaning the dataset for analysis. 
- Extract relevant information such as the date of each case, defendant gender, charged crimes, verdict, and punishment  for further analysis. 

**Part 2**
- Analyse the relationships between variables, particularly gender, using summary statistics and visualization techniques. 

**Part 3**
- Conduct text analysis, specifically examining the length of words in the trial records, conducting TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) analysis, and performing sentiment analysis. 

Each of these parts will be detailed further in the project, including a discussion of the findings.
